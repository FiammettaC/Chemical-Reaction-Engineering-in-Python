    "Recently, more and more chemical engineering students have expressed the desire to acquire basic programming skills early on in their career, with Python being the most requested language by far.\n",
    "For this reason, we decided to support the regular material taught in Chemical Reaction Engineering (28342) with an introductory Python course.\n",

    "This course is designed to be very practical since the best way to learn how to program is by programming. You will start writing and executing code from day 1, through carefully designed exercises.\n",

    "The course may be challenging and overwhelming at the beginning, but don't worry if you don't manage to complete everything.\n",
    "Each week, there will be a mandatory notebook of exercises `01-Exercises` and an additional, optional, notebook containing more challenging exercises, for learners that want to test themselves and like to *crack the code* (pun intended)."

    "1. **The best way to learn how to program is by programming**. It's normal that you cannot solve everything and you are overwhelmed at the beginning. Don't give up and just practice.\n",
    "1. **Write, test and improve code.** Do not expect to write a full program in one sitting: most programmers write, test and rewrite code many times before their program works, so do not get discouraged!\n",
    "2. **Brainstorm first.** Instead of reading a problem and looking for a solution on the Internet, try to think about it yourself. Re-read the problem, brainstorm possible solutions and try to write some code. Make sure that you actually understand what is asked. Only after you have spent sufficient time on this, look for hints elsewhere.\n",
    "3. **Learn to comment your code early on.** Before coding, visualize what you plan to do and describe it in plain, non-technical text on paper. Try to be as detailed as possible and include all the steps, even the smallest ones. This will be helpful at the beginning of your coding experience to guide you through the process and ensure you do not forget important steps. Later on, when you are more comfortable coding, it will be helpful for reference for you or other teammates. Remember that just because something seems easy for you, it does not mean your colleague can read your code and understand it right away. This is a very important principle for code deployment.\n",
    "4. **Understand what the program is doing.** It is important that you understand what your program is doing. Often, it is useful to simply *print* what you are doing, this is an easy way to visualize, and therefore better understand, the output. This approach is called tracing or printf() debugging, after the print function name in the C language)."
